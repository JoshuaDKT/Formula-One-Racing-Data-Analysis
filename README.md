# Formula-One-Racing-Data-Analysis
An insight into the data collected from Formula One races starting in 1950, all the way up to 2024. The data includes not only race-related data, but also demographic data regarding each driver, which will be explored thoroughly in the project. This project is currently a work in progress, and will be updated periodically.
